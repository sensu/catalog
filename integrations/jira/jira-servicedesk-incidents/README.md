## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Jira Service Management integration provides a Sensu pipeline that creates Jira incidents based on the events that Sensu checks generate.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration provides the following Sensu resources:

* `jira-servicedesk-handler` [handler]
* `jira-servicedesk-incidents` [pipeline]
* `sensu/sensu-jira-handler:2.0.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of supported dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

The Jira Service Management integration is compatible with the Jira Service Management dashboard. The incident page will display the Sensu event namespace, entity, and check details, including check status.
