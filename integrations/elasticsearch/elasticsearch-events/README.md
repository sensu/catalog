<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following resources:

* `elasticsearch` [pipeline]
* `elasticsearch-events` [handler]

There are no compatible dashboards for this integration.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Configure Secrets Management

   This integration requires the following [Sensu Secrets][secrets]:

   - `elasticsearch_username`
   - `elasticsearch_password`

   _NOTE: this integration creates one or more Sensu Secrets using the "env" provider by default. When using the "env" provider, the corresponding environment variables need to be set on every sensu-backend in the Sensu deployment. To add the environment variables, please modify `/etc/default/sensu-backend` or `/etc/sysconfig/sensu-backend` and restart the sensu-backend service(s)._

## Metrics & Events

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

This integration does not produce any [metrics].

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

<!-- This integration provides an alert & incident management processing pipeline for use with other monitoring integrations. By default this integration will process all events passing the [built-in `is_incident` filter][is_incident] (i.e. failing events and resolution events only). Event processing via this integration may be suppressed using [Sensu Silencing][silences] (see the [built-in `not_silenced` filter][not_silenced] for more details). -->

This integration does not produce any events that should be processed by an alert or incident management [pipeline].
