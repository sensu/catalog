## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Platform Discovery integration automatically discovers agent platforms and operating systems and automatically adds and removes entity [subscriptions] that are based on the discovered platforms and operating systems.

This integration supports the following platforms:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS
- FreeBSD
- Solaris

This integration provides the following Sensu resources:

* `platform-discovery` [check]
* `has_subscriptions` [event filter]
* `subscription-manager` [handler]
* `entity-manager` [pipeline]
* `sensu/sensu-platform-discovery:0.0.2` [asset]
* `sensu/sensu-entity-manager:0.3.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

<!-- This integration is compatible with the [{{dashboard_name}}][{{dashboard_link}}] (included w/ [Sensu Plus][sensu-plus]). -->

<!-- ![](img/dashboard.png) -->

The Platform Discovery integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Create a Sensu [API key] to use with this integration. If desired, you can also create a [limited service account] to automatically manage entity subscriptions.

   <details><summary><strong>Example: Limited service account configuration</strong></summary>

   Create an entity-manager service account with a [role], [role binding], [user] and dedicated [API key]:

   ```
   sensuctl role create entity-manager --verb=update --resource entities
   sensuctl role-binding create entity-manager --role=entity-manager --user=entity-manager
   sensuctl user create entity-manager --password $(openssl rand -hex 16)
   sensuctl api-key grant entity-manager
   ```

   **NOTE**: Use limited service accounts only for automation. Generate and discard a random password (for example, `openssl rand -hex 16` or `uuid -v4`) for users in this context.

   The `sensuctl api-key grant` command response includes a 36-character UUID v4-formatted string:

   ```
   Created: /api/core/v2/apikeys/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

   The API key is the `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` portion of the response. The `entity-manager` pipeline requires write access to the Sensu [core/v2/entities] API to add and remove entity subscriptions. This integration uses the API key for the API authentication the `entity-manager` pipeline requires.

   If you cannot generate a role, role binding, user, or API key, contact your Sensu administrator.

   </details>

   **Optional**: If you want to use a Sensu [secret] to represent the API key, you will need the secret name when you install this integration.

1. Add the `autodiscovery` [subscription] to [agents] that should run the `platform-discovery` check.

## Plugins

<!-- Links to any Sensu Integration dependencies (i.e. Sensu Plugins) -->

The Platform Discovery integration uses the following Sensu [plugins]:

- [sensu/sensu-platform-discovery][sensu-platform-discovery-bonsai] ([GitHub][sensu-platform-discovery-github])
- [sensu/sensu-entity-manager][sensu-entity-manager-bonsai] ([GitHub][sensu-entity-manager-github])

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

The Platform Discovery integration does not produce any events that should be processed by an alert or incident management [pipeline]. Instead, Sensu processes events from the `platform-discovery` check with the `entity-manager` pipeline, which automatically updates entity subscriptions in real-time.

The `has_subscriptions` event filter ensures that the pipeline processes only the first discovery event for each entity. To trigger a subsequent entity update, delete the `platform-discovery` event for the entity. The next time the check runs, Sensu will apply the entity subscription update.

## Metrics

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

The Platform Discovery integration does not produce any [metrics].
