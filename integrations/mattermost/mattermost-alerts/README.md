## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Mattermost integration is a Sensu Event Pipeline that generates alerts in the Mattermost chat service.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

* `sensu/sensu-slack-handler` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of supported dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

There are no supported dashboards for this integration.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->
Because Mattermost is [API-compatible with Slack][mattermost-api], we can use the Slack handler with Mattermost.
The handler will send event data to a channel to your Mattermost instance.
