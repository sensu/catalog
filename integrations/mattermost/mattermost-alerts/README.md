## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Mattermost integration provides a Sensu pipeline for sending alerts to the Mattermost chat service.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration provides the following Sensu resources:

* `mattermost` [handler]
* `mattermost_alerts` [event filter]
* `mattermost` [pipeline]
* `sensu/sensu-slack-handler` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of supported dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

The Mattermost integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Get a Mattermost [webhook URL][Incoming Webhooks].

   **Optional**: If you want to use a Sensu [secret] to represent the webhook URL, you will need the secret name when you install this integration.

1. Decide which Mattermost [channel] should receive Sensu alerts. You will need the channel name to install this integration.

1. Add the `mattermost` [pipeline] to one or more [checks].

     pipelines:
       - api_version: core/v2
         type: Pipeline

   ```
