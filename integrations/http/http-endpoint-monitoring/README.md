## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The HTTP Endpoint Monitoring (Remote) integration collects metrics and monitors health and performance for remote HTTP endpoints.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

The HTTP Endpoint Monitoring (Remote) integration includes the following Sensu resources:

* `{ENDPOINT_HOST}` [entity] (proxy entity generated and named for the host in the endpoint URL, such as `docs.sensu.io`)
* `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-healthcheck` [check]
* `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-metrics` [check]
* `sensu/http-checks:0.5.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

<!-- This integration is compatible with the [{{dashboard_name}}][{{dashboard_link}}] (included w/ [Sensu Plus][sensu-plus]). -->

<!-- ![](img/dashboard.png) -->

The HTTP Endpoint Monitoring (Remote) integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Get the remote endpoint URL. You will need these endpoint URL elements to install this integration:

   - Protocol (`http` or `https`)
   - Host (hostname, IP address, or domain name)
   - Port number (e.g. `8080` for http or `443` for http)
   - Path (e.g. `/healthz`)

1. Decide which Sensu agents should execute the `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-healthcheck` and `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-metrics` checks. You will need the agent [subscription] names when you install this integration.

1. If you want to use a Sensu [pipeline] to process HTTP Endpoint Monitoring (Remote) integration data, you will need the pipeline names when you install this integration.

   You can configure separate pipelines for alerts, metrics, and incident management.

1. **Optional** Disable redirect warnings.

   To disable redirect warnings, install this integration. Then, update the `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-healthcheck` and `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-metrics` checks to add the `--redirect-ok` flag in the `command` attributes.

   <details><summary><strong>Example: Check command with disabled redirect warnings</strong></summary>

   ```yaml
   spec:
     command: >-
       http-check
       --timeout 10
       --redirect-ok
       --url "https://sensu.io:443/"
   ```

   **NOTE**: The `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-healthcheck` check uses the `http-check` command as shown in the example. In the `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-metrics` check, the command uses `http-perf` instead.

   </details>

1. **Optional** Configure custom request headers.

   To use custom request headers, install this integration. Then, update the `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-healthcheck` and `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-metrics` checks to add one or more `--header` flags in the `command` attributes.

   <details><summary><strong>Example: Custom request header configuration</strong></summary>

   ```yaml
   spec:
     command: >-
       http-check
       --timeout 10
       --url "https://sensu.io:443/"
       --header "Content-Type: application/json"
       --header "X-Example-Header: helloworld"
   ```

   **NOTE**: The `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-healthcheck` check uses the `http-check` command as shown in the example. In the `{ENDPOINT_HOST}-https-endpoint-metrics` check, the command uses `http-perf` instead.

## Plugins

<!-- Links to any Sensu Integration dependencies (i.e. Sensu Plugins) -->

The HTTP Endpoint Monitoring (Remote) integration uses the following Sensu [plugins]:

- [sensu/http-checks][http-checks-bonsai] ([GitHub][http-checks-github])

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

The HTTP Endpoint Monitoring (Remote) integration produces the following events that should be processed by an alert or incident management [pipeline]:

**Request duration warning**

Generates a WARNING event if the `total_request_duration` exceeds the user-configured threshold, in seconds (default 1).

**Redirect warning**

Generates a WARNING event for HTTP 3xx response codes such as `WARNING: HTTP Status 301 for https://sumologic.com:443/ (redirects to https://www.sumologic.com:443/)`.

## Metrics

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

The HTTP Endpoint Monitoring (Remote) integration collects the following [metrics]:

Metric name | Description | Tags
----------- | ----------- | ----
`dns_duration` | Time to DNS resolution | `url`
`tls_handshake_duration` | Time to TLS handshake | `url`
`connect_duration` | Time to fetch HTTP contents | `url`
`first_byte_duration` | Time to fetch first byte of HTTP content | `url`
`total_request_duration` | Total time to complete request | `url`
