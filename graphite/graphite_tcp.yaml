# Description
#   The Sensu Graphite Handler is a Sensu Event Handler that sends metrics to
#   the time series database Graphite.
#
# Instructions
#   1. Add "graphite_tcp" to the "metric-storage" handler set.
#
#      To create the "metric-storage" handler set, please run:
#
#      $ sensuctl handler create metric-storage --type set --handlers graphite_tcp
#
#      If you already have a handler set called "metric-storage", please run:
#
#      $ sensuctl edit handler metric-storage
#
#      NOTE: the sensuctl edit command will open your default editor; please
#      modify the "handlers" attribute by adding "graphite_tcp".
#
#   2. Configure the socket information for this TCP handler, it has the following
#      defaults:
#
#      - host: localhost
#      - port: 2003
#
#      NOTE: example secret resources using the "env" provider are included in
#      this template; to add your secrets to the Sensu Backend, please modify
#      /etc/default/sensu-backend or /etc/sysconfig/sensu-backend and restart
#      the sensu-backend service.
#
#   3. More configuration options are available for this plugin; please see the
#      plugin documentation for more details.
