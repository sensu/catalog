## Overview

The `opentsdb-metrics` integration provides a Sensu pipeline for sending metrics
to the time series database OpenTSDB. This integration includes the following
resources:

* `opentsdb` [handler]
* `opentsdb-metrics` [pipeline]
* `sensu/sensu-opentsdb-handler` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

There are no compatible dashboards for this integration.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Configure Sensu [checks][check] to use the `opentsdb-metrics` [pipeline]

## Plugins

This integration uses the `sensu-opentsdb-handler`:
- [sensu-opentsdb-handler on GitHub](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-opentsdb-handler)
- [sensu-opentsdb-handler on Bonsai](https://bonsai.sensu.io/assets/sensu/sensu-opentsdb-handler)

## Metrics & Events

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

This integration does not produce any [metrics].

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

<!-- This integration provides an alert & incident management processing pipeline for use with other monitoring integrations. By default this integration will process all events passing the [built-in `is_incident` filter][is_incident] (i.e. failing events and resolution events only). Event processing via this integration may be suppressed using [Sensu Silencing][silences] (see the [built-in `not_silenced` filter][not_silenced] for more details). -->

This integration does not produce any events that should be processed by an alert or incident management [pipeline].
