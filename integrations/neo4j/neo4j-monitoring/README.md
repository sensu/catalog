## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Neo4j Metrics integration collects metrics from hosts running Neo4j Enterprise releases and outputs the metrics in Prometheus format.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following Sensu resources:

* `neo4j-metrics` [check]
* `sensu/http-checks:0.7.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

<!-- This integration is compatible with the [{{dashboard_name}}][{{dashboard_link}}] (included w/ [Sensu Plus][sensu-plus]). -->

<!-- ![](img/dashboard.png) -->

The Neo4j Metrics integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Enable the `/metrics` endpoint in Neo4j according to the [Prometheus endpoint instructions] in the Neo4j documentation.

1. Get the Neo4j `/metrics` endpoint target URL. You will need these target URL elements to install this integration:

   - Protocol (`http` or `https`)
   - Host (hostname, IP address, or domain name)
   - Port number (`2004` for http; `443` for https)
   - Path (`/metrics`)

1. Decide which Sensu agents should execute the `neo4j-metrics` check. You will need the agent [subscription] names when you install this integration.

   **Optional**: Create subscription names that map to the hosts that are running Neo4j.

1. If you want to use a Sensu [pipeline] to process Neo4j Metrics integration data, you will need the pipeline name when you install this integration.

1. **Optional** Configure custom request headers.

   To use custom request headers, install the Caddy Metrics integration. Then, update the `neo4j-metrics` check to add one or more `--header` flags in the check's `command` attribute.

   <details><summary><strong>Example: Custom request header configuration</strong></summary>

   ```yaml
   spec:
     command: >-
       http-get
       --timeout 10
       --url "http://127.0.0.1:2004/metrics"
       --header "Content-Type: text/plain"
       --header "X-Example-Header: helloworld"
   ```

   </details>
