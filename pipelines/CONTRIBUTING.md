# Contributing

We the maintainers love pull requests from everyone, but often find we must say
"no" despite how reasonable the proposal may seem.

For this reason, we ask that you open an issue to discuss proposed changes
 prior to submitting a pull request for the implementation. This helps us to
 provide direction as to implementation details, which branch to base your
 changes on, and so on.

1. Open an issue to describe your proposed improvement or feature
2. Fork [https://github.com/sensu-community/monitoring-pipelines](https://github.com/sensu-community/monitoring-pipelines)
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-pipeline`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added a pipeline to manage incidents'`)
5. Push your feature branch (`git push origin my-new-pipeline`)
6. Create a Pull Request as appropriate based on the issue discussion
