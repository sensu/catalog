## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The AWS SNS Events integration provides a pipeline for sending Sensu events to an [Amazon Simple Notification Service] (Amazon SNS) topic.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following Sensu resources:

* `aws-sns-events` [pipeline]
* `aws-sns-events` [handler]
* `sensu-aws-sns-handler` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of supported dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

The AWS SNS Events integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. [Create a new Amazon SNS topic][creating an Amazon SNS topic]. The topic must be configured to include the `sns:Publish` action.

   Read [Identity and access management in Amazon SNS] for more information.

1. Get the Amazon resource name (ARN) for the Amazon SNS topic. You will need the ARN when you install this integration.

1. Get AWS authentication credentials.
   
   The AWS SNS Events integration requires the AWS access key ID and AWS secret access key.

   **Optional**: If you want to use Sensu [secrets] to represent the AWS access key ID and secret access key, you will need the secret names when you install this integration.

1. Add the `aws-sns-events` pipeline to one or more [checks].
