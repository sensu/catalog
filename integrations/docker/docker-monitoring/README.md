## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Docker Monitoring integration monitors various Docker daemon conditions and collects Docker metrics with the Docker `/metrics` endpoint.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following Sensu resources:

* `docker-daemon-metrics` [check]
* `sensu/http-checks:0.7.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

<!-- This integration is compatible with the [{{dashboard_name}}][{{dashboard_link}}] (included w/ [Sensu Plus][sensu-plus]). -->

<!-- ![](img/dashboard.png) -->

The Docker Monitoring integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Configure the Docker daemon to provide a metrics endpoint.

   In the Docker `daemon.json` configuration file, add these two configuration values:

   ```
   "metrics-addr": "127.0.0.1:9323",
   "experimental": true
   ```

   **NOTE**: You do not need to run Prometheus to use Docker's `/metrics` endpoint.

1. Get the Docker `/metrics` endpoint target URL. You will need these target URL elements to install this integration:

   - Protocol (`http` or `https`)
   - Host (hostname, IP address, or domain name)
   - Port number (Docker default is `9323`)
   - Path (`/metrics`)

1. Decide which Sensu agents should execute the `docker-daemon-metrics` check. You will need the agent [subscription] names when you install this integration.

1. If you want to use a Sensu [pipeline] to process Docker Monitoring integration data, you will need the pipeline names when you install this integration.

   You can configure separate pipelines for alerts, incident management, and metrics.

1. **Optional** Configure custom request headers.

   To use custom request headers, install this integration. Then, update the `docker-daemon-metrics` check to add one or more `--header` flags in the check's `command` attribute.

   <details><summary><strong>Example: Custom request header configuration</strong></summary>

   ```yaml
   spec:
     command: >-
       http-get
       --timeout 10
       --url "http://127.0.0.1:9323/metrics"
       --header "Content-Type: text/plain"
       --header "X-Example-Header: helloworld"
   ```

   </details>

## Plugins

<!-- Links to any Sensu Integration dependencies (i.e. Sensu Plugins) -->

The Docker Monitoring integration uses the following Sensu [plugins]:

- [sensu/http-checks][http-checks-bonsai] ([GitHub][http-checks-github])

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

The DNS Monitoring integration produces the following alerts.

**NOTE**: To modify the threshold values for numbers of failed health checks and stopped containers, update the `docker-daemon-metrics` [check] after you install this integration.

**engine_daemon_health_checks_failed_total**

- Generates a WARNING event when there are more than five failed health checks since the Docker daemon started.
- Generates a CRITICAL event when there are more than 10 failed health checks since the Docker daemon started.

**engine_daemon_container_states_containers{status="stopped"}**

- Generates a WARNING event when there are more than five stopped containers.
- Generates a CRITICAL event when there are more than 10 stopped containers.

## Metrics
