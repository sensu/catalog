## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The SSL Certificate File Monitoring (Local) integration monitors and collects metrics for local SSL certificate files.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following Sensu resources:

* `ssl-certfile-monitoring` [check]
* `sensu/cert-checks:0.1.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

<!-- This integration is compatible with the [{{dashboard_name}}][{{dashboard_link}}] (included w/ [Sensu Plus][sensu-plus]). -->

<!-- ![](img/dashboard.png) -->

The SSL Certificate File Monitoring (Local) integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Get the path to your SSL certificate file. You will need the path to install this integration.

1. Decide which Sensu agents should execute the `ssl-certfile-monitoring` check. You will need the agent [subscription] names when you install this integration.

   <details><summary><strong>Optional: Use the default `ssl` subscription</strong></summary>

   This integration includes a built-in `ssl` subscription as the default. To use the default subscription, add the `ssl` subscription to the agents that should execute the `ssl-certfile-monitoring` check.

   </details>

1. If you want to use Sensu [pipelines] to process SSL Certificate File Monitoring (Local) integration data, you will need the pipeline names when you install this integration.

## Plugins

<!-- Links to any Sensu Integration dependencies (i.e. Sensu Plugins) -->

The SSL Certificate File Monitoring (Local) integration uses the following Sensu [plugins]:

- [sensu/cert-checks][cert-checks-bonsai] ([GitHub][cert-checks-github])

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

The SSL Certificate File Monitoring (Local) integration uses the `output_metric_thresholds` check attribute (available as of Sensu Go 6.7.0) to trigger the following alerts based on the `cert_days_left` and `cert_issued_days` [integration metrics]:

**SSL certificate expiry**

- Generates a WARNING event if the `cert_days_left` is lower than a user-configurable minimum value (default 15).
- Generates a CRITICAL event if the `cert_days_left` is lower than a user-configurable minimum value (default 7).

**SSL certificate issued days**

Generates a CRITICAL event if the `cert_issued_days` is greater than a user-configurable maximum value (default 398). Many clients do not accept certificates that are issued for more than [398 days].

## Metrics

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

The SSL Certificate File Monitoring (Local) integration collects the following [metrics]:

Metric name | Description | Tags
----------- | ----------- | ----
`cert_days_left` | Number of days until certificate expiry. Expired certificates produce a negative number. | `servername`, `subject`
`cert_issued_days` | Number of days for which the certificate is issued. | `servername`, `subject`
`cert_issued_seconds` | Number of seconds for which the certificate is issued. | `servername`, `subject`
`cert_seconds_left` | Number of seconds until certificate expiry. Expired certificates produce a negative number. | `servername`, `subject`
