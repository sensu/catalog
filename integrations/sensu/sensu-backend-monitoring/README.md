## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

The Sensu Backend Monitoring integration provides a health check for Sensu backend services, including PostgreSQL and cluster alarms.
Sensu backend services include Postgres, Etcd (coming soon), cluster alarms, and more.
The Sensu backend monitoring integration leverages the [Sensu Health API].

**NOTE**: The Sensu Backend Monitoring integration is designed for use in [federated] Sensu environments with Sensu backend health monitoring performed by a peer Sensu deployment. This integration is suitable for standalone pre-production environments but is not reliable for standalone production environments.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration includes the following Sensu resources:

* `sensu-backend-postgresql-health` [check]
* `sensu/http-checks:0.7.0` [asset]

## Dashboards

<!-- List of compatible dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->

<!-- This integration is compatible with the [{{dashboard_name}}][{{dashboard_link}}] (included w/ [Sensu Plus][sensu-plus]). -->

<!-- ![](img/dashboard.png) -->

The Sensu Backend Monitoring integration does not have compatible dashboards.

## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Get the Sensu [backend API URL], such as `http://localhost:8080`.

1. Decide which Sensu agents should execute the `sensu-backend-postgresql-health` check. You will need the agent [subscription] names when you install this integration.

1. If you want to use a Sensu [pipeline] to process Sensu Backend Monitoring integration data, you will need the pipeline names when you install this integration.

   You can configure separate pipelines for alerts and incident management.

1. **Optional** Specify a custom Sensu backend URL.

   The Sensu Backend Monitoring integration uses the backend URL you specify during installation.

   To override the default backend URL and specify a custom backend URL, add the `sensu_backend_health_url` [annotation] to the Sensu [agent] configuration file (`agent.yml`).

   <details><summary><strong>Example: Custom hostname and port configuration</strong></summary>

   ```yaml
   annotations:
     sensu_backend_health_url: "http://custom.url.com:8080/health"
   ```

   </details>

- [sensu/http-checks:0.7.0][http-checks-bonsai] ([GitHub][http-checks-github])

## Alerts

<!-- List of all alerts generated by this integration. -->

The Sensu Backend Monitoring integration produces the following events that should be processed by an alert or incident management [pipeline]:

**PostgresHealth.Healthy**

Generates a CRITICAL event if `PostgresHealth.Healthy` is `false`.

**/health endpoint**

Generates a CRITICAL event if the [Sensu /health API endpoint] is unreachable.

## Metrics

<!-- List of all metrics or events collected by this integration. -->

The Sensu Backend Monitoring integration does not produce any [metrics].

## Reference Documentation

<!-- Please provide links to any relevant reference documentation to help users learn more and/or troubleshoot this integration; specifically including any third-party software documentation. -->

* [Token substitution] (Sensu documentation): the Sensu Backend Monitoring integration supports Sensu tokens for variable substitution with data from Sensu entities
* [Sensu /health API endpoint] (Sensu documentation): the Sensu Backend Monitoring integration uses the Sensu `/health` API endpoint for data collection
